    <div>
        <h2>Optimize the Navigation</h2>
        <p>I improved the placement of the navigation bar to better fill the space in addition to rebuilding the overall interactivity and usability.</p>
    </div>
          
    <div>
        <h2>Optimize the Footer</h2>
        <p>Footers are vital to the user experience and it felt thrown together. I made sure to keep it simple, including the necessary information and making it feel more credible at the same time.</p>
    </div>
          
     <div>
        <h2>Minimize User Cognitive Load</h2>
        <p>User attention is a precious resource and by chunking content and reorganizing other data, I was able to reduce the likelihood of overwhelming the users&mdash;while balancing the overall visual hierarchy and new UI.</p>
     </div>
          
     <div>
        <h2>Improve Usability Across Website</h2>
        <p>No usability tests were conducted by the external consultancy. In result, we worked hard to improve site speed and have been actively working towards conducting usability testing.</p>
    </div>
          
    <div>
        <h2>Overhaul Content Block Modules</h2>
        <p>We needed to overhaul our modular design approach that way others on the team can more easily create and deploy content at record speed without having to wait for help from developers or designers.</p>
    </div>
          
    <div>
        <h2>Increase Results</h2>
        <p>By making these changes we were able to increase the number of page views and users engaging with the website while decreasing the average bounce rate. Our sales also increased after the product page redesign.</p>

        <h2 class="section-header"><span>Thoughts & Key Takeaways</span></h2>

        <div><h2>Be the Developer's Friend</h2>
            <p>My experience with developers is that they often aren't designers or aren't as proficient in the design aspect. I do my best to be as clear as possible in my designs, including any values needed. This is where my experience in front-end design flourishes. I am more than happy to build out my ideas that way it takes the guesswork out of it for the developer.</p></div>
        
        <div><h2>The Design Team of One</h2>
            <p>I was the sole designer, arm in arm with a sole developer. It's a big challenge and there we're definitely obstacles where I would have to make compromises. For example, in an early-stage organization, the classic design-thinking process can be tough to implement, but I did my best to make things work. The reality, yet beauty of it all though, was that I just had to be flexible and trust myself.</p></div>
