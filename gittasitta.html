            <h1>GittaSitta – Mobile App</h1>
            <p class="lede">GittaSitta is an app that helps busy moms easily and conveniently streamline the process of hiring a babysitter using their personal network while getting their life back.</p>

            <span>The Problem & Solution</span>
          </h2>
          <div>
            <h2>The Waiting Game</h2>
            <p>The process of finding a babysitter for busy moms are often a game of “text-and-wait” and typically end up without one because of the time-consuming and laborious process. Moms rarely find time to make a grocery list; they really don’t have time to play text tennis with sitters. </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>Streamline the Process</h2>
            <p>We landed on the need to create a simple, habit-forming app where moms can use their personal, trusted network of contacts already vetted and available in their phone. Ranking their sitter list and sending out an automated message in order of preference making it a "set it and forget it" tool.</p>

          <div>
            <h2>Market Segmentation</h2>
            <p>GittaSitta's market segmentation targeted 30M U.S. moms and focused on the following demographics:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Gender</strong>: Female
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Age</strong>: 28&ndash;42
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Family Size</strong>: 2+ kids
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Income Level</strong>: $70K+
              </li>
                <li>
                <strong>Behavior</strong>: Convenience shopper, tech-savy
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
            <p>GittaSitta streamlines the communication with sitters they already know and trust by allowing the user to add all of their sitters into the app, send a single message, and let the app do all the work. Whereas others are ways to <em>source</em> sitters.
            </p>
            <ul><li><strong>Care.com</strong>: GittaSitta utilizes your own trusted network of babysitters, rather than screening strangers to hire.</li>
            <li><strong>Urban Sitter</strong>: With GittaSitta, you are tapping your own trusted network vs. sourcing sitters through social media networks.</li></ul>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>Customer Validation Evidence</h2>
            <p>We utilized the usertesting.com platform to conduct demo tests with over 60 moms. Users clicked through an online demo of the app, and provided feedback on how the app worked, features they would or would not pay for, and how likely they were to download the app.</p>

            <span>Key Focus Areas</span>
          </h2>
          <div>
            <h2>Sparking Excitement</h2>
            <p>We wanted to provide moms with a simple onboarding experience to show how useful GittaSitta was. We saw it as an opportunity to also spark excitement earlier in the user journey. </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>Easy to Use While on the Go</h2>
            <p>The task of requesting a sitter was designed to be easy and familiar. Using larger buttons and a simplified UI, we created an experience that could be done one handed and on the go. </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>A Different Voice</h2>
            <p>Booking your sitter doesn't have to be stressful. The stakeholders wanted the voice of the app to feel less serious and more fun and snarky. We focused on small ways to bring a different light to finding a babysitter in the app, website, and emails.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>Rewarding Request Completion</h2>
            <p>We added a touch of gamification with a screen celebration animation to give the user a sense of delight and satisfaction for completing a sitter request with the intention of creating habit forming behaviours.</p>

        <div><h2>Designing an App During a Pandemic</h2>
            <p>This project idea started before the pandemic. Once the pandemic hit the stakeholders realized that they wanted to keep moving forward and this made us quickly change how we worked together. There were plenty of ups and downs and we learned a lot but ultimately the pandemic indicated to us that users were not ready for an app like GittaSitta. The pandemic altered a lot of things, including people's habits and safety concerns.</p></div>
