        <h1>Hi! I'm Taylor and I adore simplicity.</h1>
        <p>I am a UX/UI Designer with a background in Web Design who gets excited when given the opportunity to dive into some CSS&mdash;all while crafting beautiful, human-centered digital experiences. I currently work for Starforge Systems where I create seamless ecommerce experiences that are intuitive and impactful.</p>
        <p>Outside of design, I enjoy exploring nature and practicing mindfulness, playing video games (check out <a href="https://www.instagram.com/teapacket.acnh/">my creations on Animal Crossing</a>), cooking, and spending time with the humans and animals I love.</p>

        <h2 class="section-header"><span>My Design Process</span></h2>

    <div>
        <div class="step">01</div>
        <h2>Understand the Expectations</h2>
        <p>The first step I like to take is to make sure that there's a shared understanding of expectations, requirements, deliverables, and deadlines between myself and the team or stakeholders.</p>
    </div>
          
    <div>
        <div class="step">02</div>
        <h2>Define the Problem(s)</h2>
        <p>I listen and collect multiple perspectives which will either spark conversations or decide the problems that will be tackled. Conducting a design or ux audit can offer a way to discover issues as well.</p>
    </div>
          
     <div>
        <div class="step">03</div>
        <h2>Research and Competitor Analysis</h2>
        <p>When available, I look at any data or reports and collect other information that would be useful including the competitors strengths and weaknessess, and the type of design they implemented.</p>
     </div>
          
     <div>
        <div class="step">04</div>
        <h2>Develop Solution(s)</h2>
        <p>Ideation can be done alone but I value team collaboration as it can generate more diverse ideas. I like to take notes, sketch, and watch ideas bounce off one another while focusing on quantity over quality.</p>
    </div>
          
    <div>
        <div class="step">05</div>
        <h2>Wireframe or Prototype Creation</h2>
        <p>During this stage, I'm able to communicate and test my ideas before deep diving into the visual design. Depending on the scope, the degree of detail and fidelity may vary.</p>
    </div>
          
    <div>
        <div class="step">06</div>
        <h2>Implementing the Visual Design</h2>
        <p>This is where everything comes together. Not only does an interface need to be usable, the way it looks also affects how users experience them.</p>
    </div>
          
       </div>

<div class="section col-2">
        <h2 class="section-header"><span>How I Work</span></h2>

    <div>
        <h2>Power in Minimalism</h2>
        <p>I strive to help users focus on their goals without getting distracted or overwhelmed and ultimately abandoning the task at hand. When designing I try to contain components that are relevant and provide a clear and visible path to navigate to and through other content. With more complex tasks, I work to break it down into smaller steps in order to decrease a users' cognitive load.
            
                        

</p>
    </div>
    
    <div>
        <h2>A Shared Understanding</h2>
        <p>With my background as a Web Designer and experience in front-end development, I understand how a developer thinks. Having this understanding helps me be more flexible when working within a multidisciplinary team as I can sympathize with the developers and can accurately communicate to them my visual ideas and needs more easily.</p>
